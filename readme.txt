We discovered a fossil island where wizards, humans, and orcs lived. We want to
classify the fossil remains as males, females and children. 

-Generally, the sizes of individuals go orc > human > wizard and male > female
 > child.

-We can tell W, H, O apart from each other by DNA testing. 

-The island was contaminated with lead, which makes individuals smaller
and affects each species differently. Humans are seriously affected, orcs are
mildly affected and wizards are not affected. Each individual consumed a
different amount of lead, which we can measure.

-One final complication: We'll represent each individual as a quadrilateral.
The area of the shape is the size of the individual. We'll rotate and translate 
the shapes randomly, and the directly measured observables will be the x,y
coordinates of the four corners.

-Independent variables: W/H/O, M/F/C, lead consumption.
-Dependent variable: size.
-Directly measured quantities: four pairs of coordinates, lead, W/H/O.
-Classification problem: M/F/C.
